This demo project is a creation of basic infrastructure of test automation project using page objects pattern.

It is written in java and uses testNG and Selenium WebDriver frameworks.

The project uses Selenium standalone server (file provided - **selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar**) along with two
batch files (**startHub.bat** and **startNode.bat**) that we need to run before running the tests.

There are three web platforms set to initiate by this project, though only chromedriver(**chromedriver.exe** - v98) file is provided.

Some of the demo feature setups are not in use in the project, but only shows the ability of using reports, test retries, annotation setups etc.
